Interviews: Technical
*********************

Students in Udacity’s Nanodegree programs can submit Dry-Run Interview Projects, which focus on both behavioral and technical aspects of job interviews. These projects teach you techniques on how to prepare for and successfully answer technical and coding practice questions. They also outline common issues, such as “getting stuck” while answering a technical question, and advise you on how to overcome them. The interview project is currently available in the respective Nanodegree programs:

`Front-End Web Developer <https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001>`_
	How would you go about writing a function or analyzing a front-end web application framework?

`Data Analyst  <https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002>`_
	What are the different types of data questions you could be asked? How would you tackle a question asking you to construct a query differently from a question about statistical models or probability?

`Full Stack Web Developer <https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004>`_
	What are the components you need to address when answering a question about web security? How would you approach writing code while explaining your reasoning for it?

`iOS Developer <https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003>`_
	How would you address design and development questions using Apple's iOS Software Development Kit?

`Android Developer <https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801>`_
	How would you design and develop an Android app using the most efficient methods?

These interview courses are also available in Udacity's `Career Advisor <https://www.udacity.com/career-advisor>`_ programs!

We are currently working to expand these interview projects into other Nanodegree programs. Stay tuned!

Additionally, check out all of these options for technical interview practice. There are many ways to prep for an interview and you can decide what is most helpful for you! We recommend….
