Strategies
==============

In addition to understanding the legal process of working in the United States, it is helpful to approach this competitive job market strategically. Below, we provide resources and strategies.

------------------
Cultivate Provable Tech Skills
------------------

First and foremost, to get a job you must have concrete, in-demand technical skills. Focus on building these inside and outside of Udacity. Be sure to display these your job application materials like your resume, Udacity profile, and LinkedIn!

One article, `"Can my computer programming skills get me and H-1B visa?" <http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/question-h1b-visa-can-computer-programming-skills-28199.html>`_ should help you answer the question in the title of the article.

--------------------------
Target Specific Companies
--------------------------

Depending on their size, scale, and budgets companies will have different capacities to provide H-1B visas.

Consider researching which `companies hire the most foreign citizen employees <http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2015/04/17/the-companies-hiring-the-most-tech-talent-right-now/>`_. Often these are larger organizations.

If you are interested in smaller and mid-sized organizations, think about how you can frame the added value your international perspective might bring.

------------------
Ace Your Interviews and Get an Offer
------------------

Before you can apply for a work visa, you need to apply to jobs, ace an interview, and get an employment offer from an organization interested in sponsoring you.

Udacity provides a great deal of information about how to prepare your job application materials and prepare for interviews; utilize the Career Development courses and projects located in your Nanodegree to prepare your job application materials.

The article lists popular questions and explains how to use them. If English is your second language, this can give you an edge in your behavioral and technical interviews!

------------------
Build Experience
------------------

While you are looking for jobs that make you eligible for H-1B visa, consider opportunities outside of the US and freelance positions.

Working within your home country or other countries with more relaxed Visa processes will enhance your professional toolbox and can make you a more desirable candidate in the future.
