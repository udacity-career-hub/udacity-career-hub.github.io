<p>You are an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer preparing for an interview. This guide will help you get into the right mindset, and review essential skills that you may be evaluated on.</p>
<div class="section" id="company-and-role">
<h2>Company and Role<a class="headerlink" href="#company-and-role" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a company is looking to hire a Machine Learning Engineer, it’s clear that they are trying to solve a complex problem where traditional algorithmic solutions are hard to apply or simply do not work well enough. Needless to say, they are also extremely motivated to solve that problem (otherwise they won’t be in this business!).</p>
<div class="section" id="identify-a-core-problem">
<h3>Identify a Core Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#identify-a-core-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you need to do when applying for such a role, and this may sound cliché, is to imagine yourself in that role – find out
as much as possible about the company and position. Then ask yourself: <strong>What is one core problem I need to solve?</strong> The answer should excite you, and drive you to find out more about the problem, existing approaches, recent developments in that domain, and lead you to a bunch of more specific challenges. If you know what team you are being interviewed for, picking an appropriate problem might be easy; otherwise, choose something that is essential for the company.</p>
<p>For example, as a Machine Learning Engineer at Udacity, your primary responsibility could be to improve student engagement and retention. It is widely known that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html">MOOC completion rates are abysmally low</a>. This is partly due to factors that are out of our control, but we’d surely like to do better. Why do students drop out of our programs? Do they find our content too hard, or too easy? How can we improve student engagement in the classroom? What do students really need - how can we add value to their lives?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="explore-potential-data-sources">
<h3>Explore Potential Data Sources<a class="headerlink" href="#explore-potential-data-sources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Next, think about what data you would need to answer these questions. Some of this maybe readily available, while you may have to build in additional hooks to gather certain pieces of information. Dig into the company’s infrastructure and operations - what <a class="reference external" href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Udacitys-technology-stack">stack</a> do they operate on, what APIs they have, what data are they already collecting, etc. Most companies today have a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.udacity.com/">blog</a> where they often discuss their challenges, approaches, successes and failures. This should give you further insight into how they operate, and what products and services they might have in the pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prepare-to-discuss-machine-learning-solutions">
<h3>Prepare to Discuss Machine Learning Solutions<a class="headerlink" href="#prepare-to-discuss-machine-learning-solutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now you need to make a fairly big conceptual jump: How does machine learning fit into all this? Given what you’re trying to achieve, and the data you think might be available, can you cast it into a learning problem? What is an appropriate model to use? How would you go about training and evaluating it? To give you an example, the primary challenge that a lot of recommendation systems like Netflix and Amazon face is clustering, not prediction - i.e. once you are able to figure out groups of users who seem to have similar preference and behavior, it becomes a whole lot easier to recommend products that they may find useful.</p>
<p>This thought process will help you be prepared to talk about issues that matter to the company the most. Nobody expects you to walk into an interview and lay out a complete solution for something they’ve been working hard on for months or years! But everybody likes a candidate who shows genuine interest, motivation and curiosity for a problem that is close to their hearts.</p>
<p>Depending on your interviewer and the stage of your interview, you may be asked more technical questions, but you should try to use any opportunity you get to demonstrate that you have thought about the company and role. When asked more open-ended questions such as <a href="#id2"><span class="problematic" id="id3">*</span></a>“Describe a technical challenge you faced when working on a project and how you solved it?”- try to pick something that aligns well with the company’s interests.</p>

<h2>Skills and Sample Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#skills-and-sample-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Essential skills that a Machine Learning Engineer needs can be divided into the following groups. Within each group are topics that you should be familiar with, and some sample questions that you may be asked in an interview.</p>
<div class="section" id="computer-science-fundamentals-and-programming">
<h3>Computer Science Fundamentals and Programming<a class="headerlink" href="#computer-science-fundamentals-and-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Data structures: Lists, stacks, queues, strings, hash maps, vectors, matrices, classes &amp; objects, trees, graphs, etc.</li>
<li>Algorithms: Recursion, searching, sorting, optimization, dynamic programming, etc.</li>
<li>Computability and complexity: P vs. NP, NP-complete problems, big-O notation, approximate algorithms, etc.</li>
<li>Computer architecture: Memory, cache, bandwidth, threads &amp; processes, deadlocks, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How would you check if a linked list has cycles?</li>
<li>Given two elements in a binary search tree, find their lowest common ancestor.</li>
<li>Write a function to sort a given stack.</li>
<li>What is the time complexity of any comparison-based sorting algorithm? Can you prove it?</li>
<li>How will you find the shortest path from one node to another in a weighted graph? What if some weights are negative?</li>
<li>Find all palindromic substrings in a given string.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all such questions, you should be able to reason about the time and space complexity of your approach (usually in big-O notation), and try to aim for the lowest complexity possible.</p>
<p>Extensive practice is the only way to familiarize yourself with the different classes of problems, so that you can quickly converge on an efficient solution. Coding / interview prep platforms like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.interviewbit.com/">InterviewBit</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pramp.com/">Pramp</a> are highly beneficial for this purpose.</p>

<p>What model would you use to classify cats vs. dogs, and what would you use for dogs vs. wolves? Why?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I’m trying to fit a single hidden layer neural network to a given dataset, and I find that the weights are oscillating a lot over training iterations (varying wildly, often swinging between positive and negative values). What parameter do I need to tune to address this issue?</li>
<li>When training a support vector machine, what value are you optimizing for?</li>
<li>Lasso regression uses the L1-norm of coefficients as a penalty term, while ridge regression uses the L2-norm. Which of these regularization methods is more likely to result in sparse solutions, where one or more coefficients are exactly zero?</li>
<li>When training a 10-layer neural net using backpropagation, I find that the weights for the top 3 layers are not changing at all! The next few layers (4-6) are changing, but very slowly. What’s going on and how do I fix this?</li>
<li>I’ve found some data about wheat-growing regions in Europe that includes annual rainfall (R, in inches), mean altitude (A, in meters) and wheat output (O, in kgs/km2). A rough analysis and some plots make me believe that output is related to the square of rainfall, and log of altitude: O = β0 + β1 × R2 + β2 × loge(A)</li>
</ul>
<p>Can I fit the coefficients (β) in my model to the data using linear regression?</p>
<p>Data science and Machine Learning challenges such as those on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> are a great way to get exposed to different kinds of problems and their nuances.
